              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <ul>
                
                <li><em>Role</em>: UX/UI Designer, Researcher</li>
                <li><em>Tools</em>: Pen & paper, Illustrator, Photoshop and Figma</li>
               
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <em>Problem</em>
      <p>There are plenty of products on the market that provide information on ski resorts, forecasting, and reviews, but users have expressed they would like to find this information in one location rather than piecing it all together from multiple sites. And find a more reliable way to trust reviews.</p>
      <em>Solution</em>
      <p>A product with all the necessary information needed for a user to plan a successful ski trip. This would include: ski resort information including reviews, hotels, how to get there, costs, forecasts and conditions, town culture/vibe, activities when not skiing, and as a bonus gear reviews and global events revolving around skiing/boarding.
        Create a easy way to connect like minded skiers/boarders so they can trust the reviews they are reading.</p>

              <h3>Research Goals</h3>
              <p>
               Gain insight on the tools needed for user's to find information, reviews and book snowboard/ski trips.

              <em> Interview Questions</em>
              <li> How long have you ben skiing?</li>
              <li> How often do you travel for skiing/boarding?</li>
              <li> What do you enjoy about traveling for skiing/boarding?</li>
              <li> Where do you go first for information about traveling/planning a trip?</li>
              <li> What are you looking for? Frustration? Helpful features/information?</li>
              <li> How long have you ben skiing?</li>
              <li> How important are reviews to you?</li>
           </div>
           <div>
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <li> Reviews are important- though there was some hesitancy about trusting them. Friends are reached out to first for recommendations.
            </li>
              <li> Accuracy is important with reviews.</li>
              <li> Local knowledge is super valuable and sought after.</li>
              <li> Its not just the resort/ski area that is researched, it’s also the area (closest town, and other
                activities that users are interested in).</li>
             </div>
            <div>
              <h3>User Needs</h3>
              <li>A resource with more information in one location - rather than piecing information from multiple resources. i.e ski resort information, hotels, how to get there, costs, forecasts and conditions, town culture/vibe, activities when not skiing, and as a bonus gear reviews and global events revolving around skiing/boarding.</li>
              <li> A way to create trust within reviews and reviewers.</li>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Quotes</h3>
              
              <p> “Most general searches provide garbage results, like not enough insider information on what the runs are like. “</p>

              <p>“I enjoy exploring new ski terrain and different mountain towns.”</p>
                
              <p>“...lots of weight in friends' experiences as they are the most trustworthy informants. we often look for how good/how many reviews for an eatery or restaurant “</p>

              <h2>Wireframes</h2>
              <p>After conducting user interviews, gathering all the needed information, and understanding what users need, I developed a solution with low-fidelity prototypes. Not everything is beautiful right away. I used the Crazy 8s method for drawing sketches. With paper prototyping, I was able to quickly validate individual design deci- sions. </p>

            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal of this test is to assess the learnability for users interacting with the ski resort review app for the first time on mobile. I would like to observe and measure if new users understand the project, its value, and how to complete basic initial functions such as creating an account and searching for/navigating ski resort reviews, conditions, bookings, & directions.</p>
            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <p>How quickly/easily do users do the following:</p>
            <ul>Create an account</ul>
            <ul>Find information on ski resorts, read reviews and add
              reviews</ul>
            <ul>Find current conditions and forecasting</ul>
            <ul>Find information on accommodations</ul>

              locatio</ul>

              <p>Issue:
                Check conditions and forecasts save icon may need to be changed or placed in a locationwhere users can make sense of it and use it.</p>
                <p>Solve: I added an icon for each resort and added a “My favorites” in the hamburger menu.</p>

              <p>Issue:
                Use of more maps, so users can see where resorts and accommodations are on a map.</p>
                <p>Solve: I added a place for maps at the top of the conditions and accommoda- tion screens.</p>

              <h3>Style Guide</h3>
              <h2>Typography</h2>
              <p>I chose two fonts for this project. Adero as the heading, which has an edgy look to it and feels like it fits in nicely to the ski/snowboard vibe. I paired it with Roboto as the sub headings and body text because it felt clean, modern and easy to read in various font sizes. The two compliment each other nicely.</p>

              <h2>Color Palette</h2>
              <p>The color palette was chosen based on colors used and seen in the ski/snowboard industry. The blues correlate with the winter and snow, while the yellow creates an energetic spark.</p>
